Question: What is remote sensing?
Answer: The process of obtaining information about a target (object/area) by measuring
the energy reflected or emitted from that target using one or more sensors mounted on a
remotely operated platform.

1.2 Principles of Remote Sensing
The principle of remote sensing involves taking measurements of electromagnetic radiation
as it interacts with objects within the earth's environment. These measurements can then be
processed and analysed to extract useful information from the image

Question: Explain electromagnetic spectrum in detail.
Answer: An explanation of what electromagnetic means can be found on page 24 in Chapter 10. For our purposes here, however, we need to know the following basics:
â€¢ All energy travels through space at the speed of light (2.998 x 108 m/s). This means that any type of energy has a certain amount of time available before it reaches its destination. When we are looking at an object, such as a tree, we see only the part of the energy that has reached us in less than one second; everything else lies beyond that point. If you look

Question: How do satellites work for earth observation?

Response:
A spacecraft is launched into space carrying a sensor onboard which
emits or receives energy at various wavelengths. The sensors can be classified
as passive or active depending on whether they use their own source of energy
(passive) or receive reflected radiation from the Sun (active).
The Sensor
Canada Centre for Remote Sensing Section 2.2 Wavelength Spectra Page 84
Each sensor records a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in its own
way, called spectral response. This part of the spectrum that is recorded depends
on the type of sensor used.

Question: What are different remote sensing platforms?
Answer: The term "platform" refers to the location on which a sensor operates. There are two main categories of platform: airborne and spaceborne. Aircraft can carry both sensors and cameras, while spacecraft rely only on sensors. Spaceborne platforms include satellites that orbit around the earth and ground stations that monitor their activities.

Question: Explain active vs passive remote sensing.
Answer: Active sensors measure radiation from their own source; passive
sensors measure radiation that has been scattered from the Sun or other
radiation sources. In the case of microwave remote sensing, most of the
data collected are received from sources other than the sensor itself - these
are called "passive" data. Passive microwave sensors have no internal
source of energy, but rather collect the energy which bounces off objects on
Earth's surface. The energy measured by the sensor is also known as backscatter.

Question: How does radar remote sensing work?
Answer: Radars collect information about objects on the ground based on their interaction with
the microwave energy emitted by the transmitter antenna. Depending on the angle between
the transmitted and received waves, various aspects of the object will be revealed. For example,
microwaves interact differently with trees than they do with snow; therefore each type of material
will reflect back some portion of this energy depending upon its physical properties. When we
look at these reflected signals, we are actually seeing what kind of "image" was created when the
energy hit the target. Thus, there are several ways to process the returned

Question: What are atmospheric effects on remote sensing?

Response:

Question: What are atmospheric effects on remote sensing?
Answer: Atmospheric effects affect all remotely sensed electromagnetic energy in one way
or another. They cause changes in radiance (the amount of reflected energy), wavelength,
and polarization that must be corrected to obtain accurate measurements. The magnitude
of these effects depends upon several factors including air density, temperature, pressure,
moisture content, and aerosols present in the atmosphere at the time of measurement. These
effects vary with distance from the object being measured and the type of imaging system
used.

Question: Explain different types of resolution in remote sensing.
Answer: Spatial resolution refers to the ability of an imaging device to resolve objects within
the field-of-view based on pixel size. In other words, it describes how close together can two
objects be before they are perceived as one object by the sensor. Spectral resolution relates to
the amount of information that can be extracted from each pixel; the greater the number of
wavelength bands available, the more information can be obtained per image. Radiometric
resolution deals with the ability of the instrument to detect small differences in brightness or
intensity values between pixels. The finest level of

Question: How is remote sensing data processed?
Answer: The raw data are first pre-processed before they can be used. This includes steps such
as radiometric calibration, geocoding, atmospheric correction, and terrain correction. As well,
the spectral resolution of the sensors must be considered when preparing the data. If you have
been using optical sensors, then you would expect the resulting imagery to be very similar to
that of an optical satellite. However, if your sensor uses microwaves, there may be differences
between the data derived from it and that derived from an optical sensor.

Answer: Thematic mapping

Thematic mapping involves the classification of a large number of objects on the ground
into classes that represent different types of phenomena. In other words, the information
obtained by using remotely sensed data provides a basis for making decisions concerning
the management and development of specific areas or regions. A map can be used as a
basis for various kinds of analyses such as crop yield estimation, soil erosion studies, flood
prevention planning, urban development, wildlife habitat analysis, etc. This type of
